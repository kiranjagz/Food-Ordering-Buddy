# Food-Ordering-Buddy
Internal food ordering system using C# MVC5 and EF6

Software components used to build application: 

1. C# MVC5
2. Entity Framework 6
3. Jquery 
4. Ninject Dependency Injection 
5. Bootstrap 
6. Jquery UI
7. SQL Server 2014
8. Oauth token request for coupon get (not completed)
9. Wcf for sms and email alerts (code needs to be excluded, source code not included)

Application should build right of the bat, if build fails please exclude missing references and alert code. Other than that application should work as code built successfully and uploaded.

SQL server includes bak file for 2014. SQL script for any other version. 

Any queries let me know.
